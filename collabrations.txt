Collaboration using GitHub.
-->Collaborator Workflow:
-->Establish a workflow that all contributors will follow. A common approach is the feature branch workflow:
-->Host your project's repository on a platform like GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket. Invite your collaborators to the repository.
-->Create a branch for each new feature or bug fix.
-->Make changes in your branch.
-->Push your branch to the remote repository.
-->Create a pull request (PR) or merge request (MR) to propose changes.
-->Collaborate and iterate on the changes within the PR/MR.
-->Reviewers can provide feedback and approve the changes.
-->Merge the PR/MR into the main branch when it's ready.
