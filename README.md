This repository contains the content of git and github.
Git:- git allows developers to track changes in their code, collaborate with others, and manage software projects efficiently.
git also know as the version control system.
for example if we are working in a project so we need to fix error's and update the code.so we should redeploy the websites.but if in software's knowingly or unknowingly bugs may occur.at some point  your website  may crush.so,lots traffic will decrease. so we need to go to revert back the version.so we need to save your different version of your website in remote repositories. using the  git differnet version of project's are store on the remote repositories. so, git also know as the version control sysytem.
github is one of the example of remote repository hosting services.

Their are four levels to push the code into remote repository
1)working directory
2)stagging area
3)local repository
4)remote repository
when we init the git. this stage is known as working directory.the untracked files are in  working directory.
using git add we can send into working directory to staggind area.
using the stagging we can push any no.of files into local repository.
using git commit we are pushing the files into local repository.
using git push  we can push our files into remote repository.
